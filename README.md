# NASA-SpaceApps-2024---Seismic-Detection
Developed new algorithm to detect the timestap of the start of seismic detection. 

#ABOUT THE TEAM

We are a university team from Guanajuato that seeks to solve the Challenge of detecting seismic audios of space.

With this challenge we will apply everything we know about Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

#ABOUT THE CHALLENGE

Planetary seismology missions struggle with the power requirements necessary to send continuous seismic data back to Earth. But only a fraction of this data is scientifically useful! Instead of sending back all the data collected, what if we could program a lander to distinguish signals from noise, and send back only the data we care about? Your challenge is to write a computer program to analyze real data from the Apollo missions and the Mars InSight Lander to identify seismic quakes within the noise!

#PROJECT THE LAST DANS

##HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY

The project consists of a signal-enhancing algorithm for more efficient interpretation and response. This in order to detect the start of seismic signals from a signal file in order to delimit the information to the key moment and send it concisely to the ground instead of using all signals recorded in one day. Justification: A file with the one-day signals weighs 40 mega bytes, although the Earth data sent to Mars of are of 2 mega bytes per second robots send multiple data: as images that alone come to take 30 minutes several hours depending on the definition of the shot. It's like this, that we understand that Nasa wants to save the time of shipment messages fixing this sees detection event Spaces.

#PROJECT DETAILS

Problem: The challenge is to give the initial time at which the earthquake starts in the signal data file.
